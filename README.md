This code represents a simple To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add new tasks and delete them dynamically. Here's a breakdown:

Key Features:

1) HTML Structure:
Contains a heading for "TO-DO-LIST."
Includes an input field for users to enter new tasks.
A button labeled "Add" that triggers the add() function to add new items to the list.
A pre-existing list item (<li>) with a delete button to demonstrate functionality.
JavaScript Functionality:

2) add() Function:
Validates whether the input field is empty. If so, it shows an alert.
Creates a new list item dynamically with a delete button when the input is valid.
Appends the list item to the unordered list (<ul>).

3) dlt(event) Function:
Removes the corresponding list item when the delete button is clicked.

4) Dynamic DOM Manipulation:
New list items are created dynamically and appended to the ul element.
Each new task includes its own delete button for removal.
